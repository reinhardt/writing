# Kilburn Dynamo

London, 2022. The London fog has not diminished in the sixties, but has instead ever
increased. Within five miles of the Thames there hasn't been a single day without fog in
five years. In the early 2000s the fog has started to interfere with all kinds of
electromagnetic radiation. Not only does it limit the range of visible light, but also
of radio signals, infrared light, and microwaves. It even seems to cause disturbance in
electrical currents, making devices and appliances from lights and loudspeakers to
phones and computers prone to errors and malfunctions. London's population is ever
decreasing as people flee the fog. Criminals and other outcasts hide in the city,
looting what others have left behind, creating a separate society hidden from the
outside world.
