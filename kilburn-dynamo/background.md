# Kilburn Dynamo

London, 2022. The London fog has not diminished in the sixties, but has instead ever increased. In the past years it has started to interfere with all kinds of electromagnetic radiation. It even seems to cause disturbance in electrical wires and appliances. London's population is ever decreasing as people flee the fog. Criminals and other outcasts hide in the city, looting what others have left behind.

Ronan seeks to join the Hellbenders, a band of outcasts living in Kilburn. He seems to be interested in Rajani, a long time member of the Hellbenders. It turns out that he is following up on hints that Rajani was involved in the death of Ronan's brother Bran, who was a member of another gang. Rajani and Bran had an affair at the time of his death. The assumption that Bran was alone when he had his accident is revealed to be false - he had had a fight with Rajani that led to the deadly events.
