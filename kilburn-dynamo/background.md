# Kilburn Dynamo

London, 2022. The London fog has not diminished in the sixties, but has instead ever
increased. In the past years it has started to interfere with all kinds of
electromagnetic radiation. It even seems to cause disturbance in electrical wires and
appliances. London's population is ever decreasing as people flee the fog. Criminals and
other outcasts hide in the city, looting what others have left behind.
