She was standing in the alphabetically sorted section, scanning G to K. She was dressed all in black and white. Her hair, too, was dyed snow white, and cropped short up to over her ears. Her features looked Asian, presumably Japanese. Something about her captivated Anita exceedingly. Maybe it was the line of her cheek bones, maybe the soft curve of her nose or the pointy chin, or probably the combination of all that. The stranger was not much older than her, maybe nineteen or twenty. Over a flouncy white blouse she was wearing a long black jacket with buttons and embroidery that reminded Anita of a ringmaster or vaudeville artist. Her short black skirt had some restrained lace trimming and was contrasted by white tights. Shortly below the knees it was covered by black heeled boots.
