"Your turn," the mermaid said, her brow furrowed. The siren considered. Her blue shark could take the green octopus, but that would move it out of the centre of the board, and also put it in range of the green orca. Should she move it to the left instead and attack the seahorse? No, best leave it where it was and advance one of the shrimp to prepare a full frontal attack. Except... Except there was an even better move. After another moment's consideration she took her blue moray eel and captured the green crab, opening a trident that put her opponent in quite a predicament... or so she had thought. Why didn't the mermaid seem bothered at all? As if she had expected this, she moved her stingray right past the moray eel and placed it next to the remaining blue octopus. "Whalemate in three," she announced with a triumphant smile. Confused, the siren stared at the board and mentally played through all of her available moves. With growing dread she realised that it was true. There was no way out. No matter which of the three pieces her moray eel would capture, her opponent could answer in a way that ensured her victory in no more than three moves. And if she did not take any of the pieces, the end would only come more quickly. She, mistress of traps, had obliviously walked right into this one. With a sigh she knocked her whale over. "Rematch!" she demanded. "And this time I'm playing green."
