PJ Harvey

- Scratched my palms, there's blood on my hands
- Yes, I walk around somehow, but you have killed me
- You never get caught in the rain / When I’m drenched to the bone every time
- An unwanted sun pulls rank in the sky / The boxer isn’t finished, he’s not ready to die 

Placebo

- Before our innocence was lost, you were always one of those / Blessed with lucky sevens and a voice that made me cry
- Paint your perfect day, I don't mind this / I'm better off by the way, deeply grounded
- This is the last time I'll abandon you / And this is the last time I'll forget you / I wish I could
- Your memory's fading, I'll love you forever

One look and I saw inside / Every little thing you'd die to hide / You were the truth when you lied

And I feel / Like everything I sow / Is being swept away / Well I refuse to let you go

And if I try to get away / How long until I'm free? / And if I don't come back here / Will you remember me?

Won't you walk down the main street / Take the bridge over never ending rails
And even if you're falling down / That's an open door to the outside world
