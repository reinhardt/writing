You say you like the winter nights
Better than the summer rain

     a            F
Your memories are cold and grey
     e            a
Your expectations dark
    d          e                a
You feel alive only when you're crying
a               F
People make you sick you say
    e              a
You hide away your heart
   d                     e            a
If life's like that it's better to be dying

       a
Silken moon
         F
Break my fall
        e                 G
I don't care if I lose it all
  d                  F            a
Before this night is over I'll be gone

Bloody night
Stake my heart
I've been lost right from the start
Now I'll join the falling stars for one last song

Eternal darkness clouds your face
You veil your eyes in shades
This fallen world's not worthy of your smile
Hearts will break but never mend
And feelings are but lies
Love is only tragedy in disguise
