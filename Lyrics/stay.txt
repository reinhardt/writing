C a F d

I've had a little too much to drink
And too much time to think
Instead of coming up with solutions
The problems multiplied

You pull me left then push me right
You change your mind each single night
You're never really happy
When you are satisfied


Stay within reach
I'll be following you
Stay where you are
There's nothing we can't do
