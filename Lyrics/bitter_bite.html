Bitter Bite<br>
<br>
Follow footsteps in the dark<br>
See you shining in my heart<br>
Find me further down the stair<br>
Find my fears all waiting there<br>
<br>
Break the bars of bad behaviour<br>
See the sorrow of their saviour<br>
Let your fate decide your feelings<br>
Let your feelings fight your fate<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
Bury my bones, catch my breath<br>
Save my soul from love and death<br>
Give this soldier his last rest<br>
Take this honest heart to test<br>
<br>
Bury my bones, catch my breath<br>
Save my soul from love and death<br>
Give this glorious day an end<br>
Take the sword out of my hand<br>
<br>
Bridge:<br>
Do you know now what I always tried to say<br>
Have the purposes come nearer<br>
Has the meaning become clearer<br>
Have you dared to lift the veil before your eyes<br>
Before the lies<br>
Oh how she tries to fight the fever in her head<br>
<br>
Idle idols I have broken<br>
Taken terror as a token<br>
Bathed in beauty, howl in horror<br>
Darkest days without tomorrow<br>
<br>
Echoes of your vow of vengeance<br>
Anger grows with cruel rememberance<br>
Smash the stone and iron icons<br>
Soothe your soul with vicious violence<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
<br>
Ripped apart, persistent pleasure<br>
Perfect pain's your tranquil treasure<br>
Taunt the demons of your dreams<br>
Sew the silence at the seams<br>
<br>
Can you come to lift me higher<br>
Can I call you my desire<br>
Where's my memory of you<br>
Does this dream at last come true<br>
<br>
