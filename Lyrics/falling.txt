       a
In the daytime it's alright
        e
But I'm terrified at night
d
Hold me
G                a
Cause I feel I'm falling

Will it always hurt like this?
Won't the horror turn to bliss?
Hold me
Cause I feel I'm falling

Can we try to set it right
Is it ending here tonight
Hold me
Cause I feel I'm falling
