You dominate
I can't resist you
You pull me apart
Till nothing is left

a F d F
You spin me around
I turn towards you
You pull me close
You leave me to crash

a G F
Gravity 
In the grip of forces far beyond myself 
In the space between us something's moving 
In the light of another I begin to shine
In the eye of the storm, in the blackest of holes, in perihelion

"Up" is always away from you

a F d G
For a thousand years
You kept me moving
You kept me circling
Always coming back

a F d F
I won't get up
I'll keep my head down
'Cause up is always
Away from you

Gravity
In the darkness out there, who will help me see 
In the hope of landing somewhere safely 
In the best intentions sleeps a bitter end 
In the eye of the storm, in the blackest of holes, in perihelion

a F d G
I heard Mercury was falling
While you stood at the gate
They say you came too late
But they've been wrong before

a G F
Gravity
In the grip of forces far beyond myself
In the hope of landing somewhere safely
In the light of another I begin to shine
In the eye of the storm, in the blackest of holes, in perihelion
