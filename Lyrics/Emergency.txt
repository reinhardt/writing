The ghost of winter has returned
I feel the darkness rising
I miss the bridges I have burned
Regrets that aren't surprising
a d a F
Little by little, day by day
I turn transparent, fade away
It's hard to hold my thoughts at bay
When all my senses turn to grey

a e d F G
Hold what is left of me
Close to the place I once was
Turn what has broken me
Into a neverending memory

C          G            F
So drag me out into the cold
         a
Let them see my sickness
C          G                F
Recite the lies that I have told
             a
In case they need a witness
C           G                 F
Reflect the pain my crime has bought
              a          C
When love was all I ever sought




a e d F
Sweet as sugar, dark as death
Blurs my senses, takes my breath
Fuels my fire, burns my soul
Sly as devils, black as coal

This avalanche, it swallows me
An unequalled emergency
Thrillingly
Seducing me
Terribly
Destroying me
