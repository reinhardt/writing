Sweet as sugar, dark as death
Blurs my senses, takes my breath
Fuels my fire, burns my soul
Sly as devils, black as coal

This avalanche, it swallows me
An unequalled emergency
Thrillingly
Seducing me
Terribly
Destroying me 

The ghost of winter has returned
I feel the darkness rising
I miss the bridges I have burned
Regrets that ain't surprising
Little by little, day by day
I turn transparent, fade away

Hold what is left of me
Close to the place I once was
Turn what has broken me
Into a neverending memory

So drag me out into the cold
Let them see my sickness
Recite the lies that I have told
In case they need a witness
Reflect the pain that my crime brought
When love was all I ever sought
