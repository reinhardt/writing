It's been quite a while
And I've had lots of time
To pick up my pieces
And come back to life

But what have I found
Ringing bells and fading traces
It sure freaks me out
All those voices, all those faces

The storm is over now
But the rain has just begun
And I will tear myself
To pieces as I run

And have I learned
I bet I have
I was chasing shadows
Now I'm kiling time

I'll remember
As I fall
That I could lose
It all

The mess you made of me
And the secrets that I hide
Have passed before my eyes
Then faded from my mind
