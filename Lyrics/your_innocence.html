You taught me how to steal your time<br>
I used to torture you with good intentions<br>
I didn't even know your name<br>
But I'd gotten used to breaking your defenses<br>
<br>
You took me home for the first time<br>
I broke your mirror and your sister's little heart<br>
Your mother thought I was divine<br>
I guess I really should have known right from the start<br>
<br>
I never thought it was a crime<br>
I found it hard to deal with your defiance<br>
Your innocence was hard to find<br>
And every time we'd end up with denials<br>
<br>
You had to let me taste your lips<br>
You kept me with you to distract you from your pain<br>
When I began to lose my grip<br>
I was alone and naked in the pouring rain<br>
