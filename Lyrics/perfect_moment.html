<br>
As I stepped out of the fever<br>
And into the night<br>
There she was like a starburst<br>
Burning so bright<br>
<br>
And as they played rock'n'roll<br>
And the guitars were crying<br>
Like the bells up in heaven<br>
When the angels are dying<br>
<br>
Then she walked up to me<br>
Beads of sweat on her brow<br>
Put her hands on my hips<br>
Said, 'Boy, it's never or now'<br>
<br>
Tell me, baby<br>
Have you come to save me<br>
I was waiting for the perfect moment<br>
You showed me how blind I was<br>
<br>
And we danced in the subways<br>
And in alleys of light<br>
We went up on the rooftops<br>
And looked out at the night<br>
<br>
And the highways were burning<br>
Like rivers of fire<br>
And the skyscrapers sang<br>
Of hope and desire<br>
<br>
Behind a mountain of clouds<br>
The full moon did rise<br>
And as she turned and touched my face<br>
I got lost in her eyes<br>
