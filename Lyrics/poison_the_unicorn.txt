Beauty always lies in someone's eyes
And silence takes the ones who wait forever
Passion only blooms when beauty dies
I never thought that we could be together

Our story seemed like one that's seldom told
My desperate whispers swore there'd be no other
But now the days have grown so short and cold
And nighttime never fails to see me suffer

I never saw you look so desperate and forlorn
I never hoped that I would reap much more than scorn
I tried to cling to every oath that I had sworn
I never thought my fears and dreams would be reborn
I can't believe that you're the one that I had torn
I never thought that I would poison the unicorn

Beauty always lies in someone's eyes
And darkness takes the ones who dream forever
Sorrow mostly blooms when passion dies
I never dared to hope we'd be together

Stranded on an island in your dreams
Longing for a life I can't remember
Inside I'm much frailer than it seems
Hopelessly refusing to surrender
