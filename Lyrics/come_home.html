Come home, come home my dear<br>
There's nothing you have to fear<br>
Come back, come back my love<br>
Have faith in God above<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
Under a sky of dust<br>
He will be there for us<br>
Under a fading sun to light our way<br>
Upon the battlefield<br>
I know he'll be our shield<br>
Right beside us until the brand new day<br>
<br>
Come on, come on my sweet<br>
Don't stay out in the street<br>
Come now, come now my star<br>
Don't stay away so far<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
</p>
