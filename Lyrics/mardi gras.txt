c        g              f     Ab
Will you join me at the mardi gras
c            Bb                 Ab   f
Where all my fears are going to hide away
c        g             Ab    f
Come on join me at the mardi gras
c         Bb               Ab    f
And we'll give this song a new beginning

c        g              f     Ab
Will you meet me at the mardi gras
c        Bb             Ab        f
A silent prayer for the desperate souls
c        g             Ab    f
Come on meet me at the mardi gras
c         Bb                   Ab    f
Don't you know in time they'll be forgiven

Eb  f  Ab  c   Eb  f  Ab  f
Ah ah...

c        g              f     Ab
Will you hold me at the mardi gras
c            Bb                  Ab      f
Where silent birds still sing of unknown lands
c        g             Ab    f
Come on hold me at the mardi gras
c          Bb                   Ab           f
Some sweet day they're going to spread their wings

c        g              f     Ab
Will you kiss me at the mardi gras
c           Bb                  Ab     f
I fear that time has sweapt our dreams away
c        g             Ab    f
Come on kiss me at the mardi gras
c             Bb            Ab      f
Like coloured pebbles in an endless sea

Eb  f  Ab  c   Eb  f  Ab  f
Ah ah...
Eb  f  Ab  c   Eb  f  Ab  f
Ah ah...
