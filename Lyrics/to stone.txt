I turn to stone
I still breathe the world you built for me
When you were living by my side
I still kiss the hands that cared for me
When I was crying in the night
I still look for you in silence
Hoping for your light
Turning all my vows to wishes
Since the day I died

Guardian angel
Write my epitaph
Turn my feet to clay
Silent starlet
Tear my world apart
Don't let my hope decay

Why do my days go by so fast
Why do my summers never last
Why do I still shed all these tears
How can it hurt after all these years

I turn to stone
I could sacrifice my memories
But I could never lose my pride
I could surrender to my enemies
But I could never take their side
I could break the spell that binds you
Or let you lose your mind
Unleash the starlight deep inside you
Leave the world behind
