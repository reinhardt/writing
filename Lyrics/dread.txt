The kiss of dread when silence falls
The nameless fear as darkness calls
A drop of anger in the sky
A sigh of sorrow tells you why

A token of a promised dream
A glimmer of a world unseen
A ray of light that passed you by
A laugh of joy that tells you why

Bewitched by unfulfilled desire
Betrayed by lust that burns like fire
Enflamed by love that's just a lie
Enraged by hope that tells you why
