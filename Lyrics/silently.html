<p style="text-align:center">
Silently closing the doors of my mind<br>
Finally leaving the memory behind<br>
The pain stays outside as I turn off the light<br>
Shut out your face and let in the night<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
I held you close, I held you dear<br>
You were the one I loved and feared<br>
You caught my eye, you caught my ear<br>
I clung to you through all these years<br>
I called to you, you did not hear<br>
You just brought me bitter tears<br>
<br>
Paying the price now for giving my soul<br>
Watching the needle tear hole after hole<br>
Leaving me bleeding and fading away<br>
I'll never again see the light of the day<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus<br>
