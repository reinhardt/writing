Will you still be hungry when you'll come
Will you still long to see the sun
Will you be thankful for another day
Or will you throw your life away

Will you still be the same when you return
Will you be wiser for all you'll learn
Will you wrap your arms around me
Will you stay when you have found me

Will you leave your fears behind
Will you find your peace of mind
What will you sacrifice to be
An inseparable part of me

Will you lay your guns down in the end
Or will you make one final stand
Will you keep a peace that's long grown thin
Or give the wheel another spin

Will you take your place without complaint
Will you live your life just like a saint
Will you build a castle in the air
What will it take to keep you there
