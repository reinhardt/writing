This is where you left me standing
Six miles from home but so far from your heart
The streets were dirty and the lights of the arcade
Were scorching my skin

Worlds built on another's shoulders
Never really last, I know
But somehow you and I seemed
So much more at that time

It was just Dixgard that kept us together
Roses were never red enough for me
You were my queen of diamonds and my bird of prey
But you were never what you seemed to be


Was I not strong enough
Why did you change your mind
Where did we go wrong
Who are you now
