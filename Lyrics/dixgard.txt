This is where you left me standing
C                       d                a
Six miles from home but so far from your heart
                               e
The streets were dirty and the lights of the arcade
     F
Were scorching my skin

Worlds built on another's shoulders
Never really last, I know
But somehow you and I seemed
So much more at that time

It was only Dixgard that kept us together
           a                    G
Roses were never red enough for me
            F                        G
You were my queen of diamonds and my bird of prey
             F                        d
But you were never what you seemed to be
            e              F         a
No you were never what you seemed to be

        a               d
Hold my hand for just a moment
        a                           e
Hold my breath the rest of my whole life
                        G
I never noticed we were running
       a
Out of love

a d e G
Was I not strong enough
Why did you change your mind
Where did we go wrong
Who are you now
