  Could you please keep your distance
Apologies will make it worse
Reactivate your systems

The winds to which you set your sail
Will change your course and make you stall
Trying too hard will make you fail
As sure as never trying at all

You dive too deep, you go too far
That's why you lose your allies
And did you find your northern star
As you tried to chase the sunrise
