The band now plays a slower song
I find my thoughts are drifting
I wish that I could have you here with me

I settle back, enjoy the show
And think of how I met you
You've made my life much better in many ways

a G F G
I don't have no big words
To tell you how I feel
I don't know all that much
But I'm sure that this is real
I don't like what is past
But I can't wait for the future
All I want is to make this last

I don't care what the people say
We're made for one another
I see it when I look into your eyes

I feel it when I touch your skin
And when I hear your voice
We may be down but soon enough we'll rise (again)
