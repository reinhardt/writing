You taught me how to steal your time
I used to torture you with good intentions
I didn't even know your name
But I'd gotten used to breaking your defenses

You took me home for the first time
I broke your mirror and your sister's little heart
Your mother thought I was divine
I guess I really should have known right from the start

I never thought it was a crime
I found it hard to deal with your defiance
Your innocence was hard to find
And every time we'd end up in denials

You had to let me taste your lips
You kept me with you to distract you from your pain
When I began to lose my grip
I was alone and naked in the pouring rain
