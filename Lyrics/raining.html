<br>
You went away to LA<br>
Wouldn't stay, it was hard to say<br>
If you were finding your own way<br>
Or only leaving me behind<br>
And it was raining on that night<br>
And the stars were out of sight<br>
<br>
I went down to the town<br>
To a place that I had found<br>
And I was dreaming for a moment<br>
And I thought I saw your face<br>
But it was raining on that day<br>
And the sun had gone away<br>
<br>
A drop of rain<br>
For every feeling that you gave<br>
And took away<br>
A ship of fools in a storm<br>
On the great wide ocean<br>
For the hope that you will be alright<br>
It's still raining on the seashore<br>
And I look out at the waves<br>
<br>
The tide has turned, the fires burned<br>
I don't know what I have learned<br>
There are cracks in all my bottles<br>
And my clothes look pretty worn<br>
It's raining in the yard<br>
And we're so far apart<br>
