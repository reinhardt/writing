Ignore the things that bring you down
Close your eyes to the shadows in the hallway
Don't clear the mist, don't lift the veil
Cause the things you might see will just kill you

And it's not that holy
It's just something that we do

Chocolate coated candy bars
Cherry flavoured sugar bubbles
Custom coloured cotton cloth
Premium comfort northern goose down

Anger pain false compromise
Terror fear despair frustration
Boredom greed illusion hate
Psycho schizo paranoia

G C D e (b)

Oh, my world
When did you turn so black
Who will I run to now
Everything that seemed so clear
Now is one more cause for fear
What was precious in my eyes
Turned to madness, dust and lies

e b a C

Fall with me now
Never to turn back no more
Fall, be my inspiration
For the final chapter
Fall, see the towers crumble
Watch the madmen stumble
Fall as the seas are boiling
And the sky is burning
Fall, can you reach the silence
Touch the bonds that free us
Fall, be my liberation
Be my inevitable end

e a b C e

And just as it ended it begins again
One more time the stage is set
