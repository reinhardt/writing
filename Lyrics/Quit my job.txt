Quit my job and packed my bag
I was feeling restless
Hit the road to ease my mind
Followed the river south

60 miles down highway 9
I met Jesus in a truck stop
He said take your Mustang and drive on, boy
Your sins have been forgiven


The road to nowhere is closed for maintenance
The motel lights are low
Where's the dream that kept this land alive


Sunday morning church is over
I find Jane sitting on my porch
Her dress is creasy and her hair's a mess
Asks if she could stay the night

Yeah Jane could always spark a fire
She was one of those
Never too proud to come for comfort
In the days before September
