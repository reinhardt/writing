If I sent you a rainbow<br>
To light your love anew<br>
If I caught a shooting star<br>
To show my love is true<br>
<br>
Chorus 1:<br>
And if I raced wild horses<br>
Over dry and dusty plains<br>
Would you believe that every breath without you<br>
Means the greatest of all pains<br>
<br>
If you burnt all tracks behind you<br>
I would still be following you<br>
If you hid in the darkest dungeon<br>
I would follow you right through<br>
<br>
Chorus 2:<br>
And one day I may be dying<br>
But my love will still survive<br>
To remind you in your deepest dreams<br>
That love is stronger than life<br>
