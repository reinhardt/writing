Sanity and Gasoline
G
I'm sober as I've ever been
d
Between the lines I search for fire
F      e
Always less than I desire
a
Shades of amber in your eyes
G
I know beauty never dies
d
Still I hear their mourning cries
F          e
Where your cooling body lies

Inside I feel all the same
G        F       e       a
Anguish, beauty, sorrow, shame
