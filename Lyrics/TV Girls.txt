Why is my girlfriend not as pretty
As the girls on the TV?
Why is her hair not as blond?
Why are her eyes not as blue?
Why are they looking so much better
Then her?

I wish I could talk
Like those guys in the TV shows
To be as funny and as witty
And maybe just as pretty
Always the right words to say
