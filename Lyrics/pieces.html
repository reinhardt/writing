It's been quite a while<br>
And I've had lots of time<br>
To pick up my pieces<br>
And come back to life<br>
<br>
But what have I found<br>
Ringing bells and fading traces<br>
It sure freaks me out<br>
All those voices, all those faces<br>
<br>
The storm is over now<br>
But the rain has just begun<br>
And I will tear myself<br>
To pieces as I run<br>
<br>
And have I learned<br>
I bet I have<br>
I was chasing shadows<br>
Now I'm kiling time<br>
<br>
I'll remember<br>
As I fall<br>
That I could lose<br>
It all<br>
<br>
The mess you made of me<br>
And the secrets that I hide<br>
Have passed before my eyes<br>
Then faded from my mind<br>
<br>
