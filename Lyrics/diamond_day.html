Diamond Day<br>
<br>
I watch the fleeting memories<br>
Of a life I never led<br>
They drift into the future<br>
My lips get barely wet<br>
With the tears of happy brothers<br>
And friends I never had<br>
For crimes I've not commited<br>
With girls I never met<br>
<br>
Well, it's been cold and long<br>
Inside here<br>
Diamond day<br>
Alway keep inside<br>
Though I don't want to stay<br>
<br>
Here you are again<br>
To save me<br>
Diamond day<br>
Hold my hand and cry<br>
I'll wipe the tears away<br>
<br>
Still it's only me<br>
Who has come this way<br>
This is my diamond day<br>
