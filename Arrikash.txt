I'd like to say something like "I always had that feeling that something was waiting for me out there", but I guess I was just bored. There was just not enough there to challenge me on an underdeveloped planet like my home. I was pretty bright and had a keen eye, so I absorbed every bit of knowledge I could lay my hands on. I started fixing spaceships for residents and visitors alike, and squeezing every bit of power out of their engines for the posh local kids. As soon as I could afford a piece of metal that I figured would make it past the stratosphere, I patched it up as best I could and never looked back. My skills and wits earned my some ISK, until I finally made enough for university. With skills like mine and a graduation to prove them, the universe was open to me, I figured.
