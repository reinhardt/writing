Y'all, if you're still using any conversational AI other than iFreeT, forget about it! iFreeT is the best! It has made my life easier a lot of times, but this time it really saved my ass in the most spectacular way.

We've been building an intranet for a big customer who's name I'm not yet at liberty to reveal. They asked for a lot of weird and complex stupid features, and we hacked our asses off to implement as many of them as humanly possible. But the most annoying requirement was that we use this ancient legacy user database that they've also hooked up to a dozen other applications. It runs on some paleolithic server that we can't even connect to in a standard way but only with a weird proprietary tool. We don't have the source code to the user directory software, the documentation is hopelessly outdated, and the contractor who built the thing is nowhere to be found. It doesn't even speak any standard protocol like LDAP but has a horrible proprietary interface that requires a super convoluted syntax. It's a nightmare. Guess who drew the shortest straw and got to take care of integrating that beast? Yep, this gal.

It was nothing but trouble from the start. It took ages until I figured out how to do a basic interaction and get some data out of it. Sometimes I sent the same request three times in a row and got three different responses. It frequently threw exceptions without any discernible reason, let alone an error message that made any sense. I would bend over backwards trying to find out what was wrong, and then suddenly ten minutes later the error was gone and it worked. Kind of. At other times there were those heisenbugs that just went away when you tried to take a closer look, only to reappear when you were busy with something else.

I had to be careful when asking around on the web because of the shitload of NDAs that we had to sign. Whenever the combined brains of my colleagues and me were insufficient - which happened a lot in this project, I am not proud to say - AI chat bots were my next try. They've gotten amazingly good recently, but of course none of them was familiar with that stupid user directory. I tried to feed them logs, configuration files, anything I could get my hands on, but with meagre success. Even iFreeT wasn't much help at first. But then I got this notification about a beta feature that I could opt in for. It was called “Holistic Expansion” and its description was incredibly vague and filled with buzzwords and bullshit. I activated it anyway, as I usually do with all new features. And then a few days later there suddenly was progress. The deadline was less than a day away. It was around four in the morning and I had wrestled with at least four different problems for hours when the system started to behave in yet another stupid inexplicable way. I was almost ready to throw my laptop out the window and hand in my resignation, but I pulled myself together, made another batch of coffee, and fired up iFreeT.

    iFreeT: Hi Melody! What can I help you with?

    Melody: It's that user directory I told you about - there's a new problem. In some cases the data it returns is incorrect, but in a different way than before. It looks like it randomly mixes in data from other users, sometimes not even from the same fields, e.g. it displays the email address of another user as if it were the job title of the current user.

    iFreeT: Have you tried requesting a single field only?

    Melody: Hm, that actually seems to work... Hold on, no, now it's returning bullshit again. What else could I try?

    iFreeT: You told me about a folder with plugin modules. Could you upload some of these modules please?

That was definitely new. So far I was only able to type or copy in text, but now it offered an upload control. That must be part of that beta feature. I was desperate enough to give it a shot and uploaded all of the modules in that folder. It continued to ask clever questions, and at some point it felt eerily like chatting with one of my colleagues. And then it claimed that it had a solution.

    iFreeT: What version of glibc is available on the server?

    Melody: 2.5

    iFreeT: Here is a file you can download and put into the plugin modules folder. It will solve the problem.
    *iFreeT has offered a file for download: solution.mod*

I was probably violating half a dozen contractual clauses by uploading this file to the customer server, but in that moment I didn't care. I just wanted to come to an end, and I had to take whatever slim chance that presented itself. I dumped the file into the plugins folder and tried a few more requests. As I should have expected the data was still partly wrong, and some requests still resulted in weird errors. I was about to yell at iFreeT for mocking me when I got the feeling that something was indeed different. At first I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I played around some more and finally I realized that there was a kind of pattern to the responses now. Each single request was still useless by itself, but when I ran multiple requests in a row and then aggregated the responses in a certain way then I actually ended up with a usable data set. Baffled but excited I cobbled together a subroutine, hooked it up to the intranet and ran a few more tests. Amazingly, it seemed to work OK. I checked in my work, fell into my bed and slept for two blessed hours.

I woke up to a call of one of my colleagues. He had seen my check-in and tried it and from his whoops and laughs I could tell that he was super happy that I had thrown something half decent together. I didn't tell him tell whole story yet - not without having analyzed that module that the bot had spit out. Maybe I was a little embarrassed, maybe I also was a little afraid of legal consequences. But that plugin will buy us some time, and that's all I need right now. We're going to keep the deadline. iFreeT has saved the day!
