# Operation Purple Raven

*There's a job to be done. You know you're the right person for it, but you're going to need help. You have a few people in mind. Assembling them will take some effort. And even with the perfect team the job will be far from easy.*

*Time to get cracking.*

## Introduction

Operation Purple Raven is a single player tabletop role playing game. You play an operative that assembles a team of specialists for a job. Challenges are resolved by rolling dice. You will need to make judgements what risks to take and when to play it safe. Your team will be outnumbered, so you have to rely on stealth to get the job done. If you're discovered you will have to move fast or be crushed by the opposition. But as you have only the best on your team, there is a chance that you'll make it.

## What You'll Need

* At least one six-sided die (d6), preferably three or more
* A couple of markers (pegs, coins, stones, etc.)
* Optional: a printout of the game board

## Basics

### Stealth And Discovery

Your team is on a mission that requires secrecy. Your efforts at remaining undetected are represented by the stealth counter. You start with a stealth of 10. In the course of the game you can lose stealth. Running out of stealth means you are discovered.

If you're using the game board, place a marker on the stealth bar at the number 10 before starting to play.

If your stealth reaches 0 at any time then you are discovered. You have to fight off enemies while trying to complete the mission. From now on, any skill check that would result in losing stealth causes the character to be wounded instead.

If you want to adjust the difficulty of the game, choose a different starting stealth, e.g. 12 for an easier game or 8 for a harder one.

### Skills And Checks

Challenges are resolved by skill checks. Each character has skill 3 in their speciality and a base skill of 2 for all other checks.

Roll a number of d6 equal to the skill value. The highest roll counts. A 5 or higher means success. A 4 or lower means failure. Both successes and failures can have side effects as follows:

* 6: success
* 5: success, but lose 1 stealth
* 4: lose 1 stealth
* 3: lose 1 stealth
* 2: wounded
* 1: wounded

lose 1 stealth: move the stealth marker to the next lower number
wounded: place a marker on the wounded (blood drop) symbol of the character that attempted the skill check

*Notes and clarifications*

For example, a Hacker doing a hacking challenge uses 3d6. A Medic doing a spying challenge uses 2d6.

A character's effective skill can be lower than their initial value due to penalties in the finale (see ‚ÄúThe Finale‚Äù). An effective skill of 0 or lower means the character can not attempt a skill check.

Some skill checks can be retried, depending on the game phase and type of check. The side effects are always applied before a retry is attempted.

### Wounds And First Aid

A wounded character does not suffer any penalties, but if they are wounded again, they are incapacitated. You can not use them to perform skill checks until they receive first aid.

Once after a successful skill check (i.e. a recruitment or a challenge), you can attempt to give first aid to a character. Pick a character that has been wounded once or twice and is going to receive first aid. Then pick a character that tries to give first aid and make a skill check on their medic skill. Success stabilizes one wound. Remove one marker from a wounded symbol (blood drop) of the character. A wounded character returns back to a healthy state (i.e. the character is no longer wounded). An incapacitated character returns back to the wounded state and has one wound left.

If you fail the check you may not retry until after the next successful challenge or recruitment. As in any skill check you can lose stealth on a 2, 3 or 4. On a 1 or 2 it is not the character who makes the skill check that is wounded. Instead the first aid is botched and the character receiving the first aid is wounded again. If the character was wounded before they are now incapacitated. Add a marker to the second wounded symbol. If the character was incapacitated they are now dead and out of the game. Remove all markers from the character.

*Notes and clarifications*

For example, a Medic performing first aid rolls 3d6. A Demolitions Expert doing first aid rolls 2d6. Don't forget to subtract any penalties if you're in the finale.

The character performing the first aid can also be the wounded character themselves.

## The Game Phases

The game is played in three phases:

1. Assemble A Team
2. The Run
3. The Finale

Before starting with the first phase, place a marker on the number 10 of the stealth bar or make a note that your stealth is at 10.

### Phase 1: Assemble A Team

There are six characters, each with a different speciality:

1. ‚å®Ô∏è Hacker
2. üîç Spy
3. üî≠ Sniper
4. üí£ Demolitions Expert
5. üîß Mechanic
6. üíâ Medic

For every character roll 1d6 to determine what complication you face when recruiting them (in parentheses is the speciality required to overcome the complication):

1. track down (hacker)
2. sneak out (spy)
3. guard (sniper)
4. break out (demolitions)
5. repair (mechanic)
6. patch up (medic)

Mark the complication on the speciality wheel of each character's area on the game board. You can roll for all characters first and then determine the order in which you recruit them.

You start out with one character. Pick or randomly determine their speciality. This is your main character. Keeping them alive and healthy may pay off later in the finale. You can recruit up to three more characters, making a total team of four, but you risk losing stealth or wounding other characters while recruiting them.

You get your main character for free. You can disregard the complication roll you did for this character. Remove the corresponding complication marker and instead place a marker on the number of your main character to indicate that they are on your team. For the other characters you have to succeed at skill checks to recruit them to your team.

Pick a character you want to recruit (the target). Then pick a character that is already on your team. This character will try to overcome the complication. If their speciality matches the complication you have rolled for the target, you can use their speciality skill (3), otherwise the base skill (2). Make a skill check (see Skills And Checks). If you are successful, place a marker on the target character's recruitment grid on the board, or make a note if you're not using the board. If you get a failure you can retry as many times as you like, but you have to suffer the side effects of the check result.

You may need to make additional skill checks to recruit a character. The number of checks required is equal to the number of characters already on your team - the first character is free (0 on your team), the second character needs one skill check, the third needs two etc. Once you have successfully made the required number of skill checks (markers on the recruitment grid) the target character has been successfully recruited. Remove the recruitment markers and instead place a marker on the character's number to remind you that you've recruited this character.

You can stop recruiting at any time if you don't want to risk more side effects. If you've already made a number of checks for a target their results are disregarded. Remove any recruitment markers from that target. You have to stop recruiting when you have a total of four characters, including your main character. Should a character die (see below) during the recruiting phase they still count towards the limit of four.

Remove all complication markers and move on to phase 2.

*Notes and clarifications*

It may be tempting to pick the Medic as your main character to increase your chances at first aid, but this will limit your first aid capabilities in the finale when your main character will be busy with the Tough Challenges (see The Finale).

It can happen that you need to make e.g. a spy check to recruit the spy. Tough luck. Some character with another speciality will have to attempt the check at the base skill.

### Phase 2: The Run

The run consists of 6 challenges. If using the board, place a marker on the first run challenge on the board.

For each challenge, roll on the character table to determine what speciality is needed to resolve it. If you roll a 6, pick any of the other 5 specialties. (Medics are special, they don't get regular challenges in this phase of the game, but they can provide first aid.) Then pick a character that will attempt to resolve the challenge. If the character has the speciality that is required for the challenge you can use their speciality skill (3) to resolve the check, otherwise you use the base skill (2).

If the check fails, you have to retry, either with the same character or a different one. If the check succeeds, move the marker to the next first aid symbol. You now have a chance to heal any wounded characters (see ‚ÄúWounds And First Aid‚Äù). Then move the marker on to the next challenge.

## Phase 3: The Finale

If at least one character makes it through the run, then it's time for the finale. It consists of three Tough Challenges, each of which requires at least one skill check. The type of the Tough Challenges is your main character's speciality. Pick one character who takes all of the Tough Challenges. We call them the finale character. If your main character is still alive and well, this is their chance to shine!

If using the board, remove the marker from the last run challenge and place it on the first Tough Challenge.

The finale character takes all skill checks at a -1 penalty, i.e. you roll one die fewer than you usually would. This includes skill checks for a Tough Challenge but also for side challenges and first aid. However, the team can find ways to make things easier for the finale character.

Before each Tough Challenge there are two side challenges. Roll 2d6 to determine their types. This time a 6 doesn't mean you get to pick, but an actual medical challenge. Place a marker on the speciality wheel of the side challenge to indicate the type. You may pass at either or both of the side challenges. Passing means you don't get any benefits but also don't incur any side effects. To attempt a side challenge, pick any of the characters on your team and make a skill check. You may (but do not have to) retry on failure, with the same character or a different one. You can retry multiple times, until you either succeed or decide to give up. When you succeed at a side challenge, remove its marker, or make a note.

One success at a side challenge removes the penalty from the following Tough Challenge. A second success at a side challenge means the skill check for the Tough Challenge succeeds if you roll a 4 or higher instead of the usual 5 or higher.

After the side challenges are resolved, make the skill check for the Tough Challenge, taking into account the penalties and benefits as just explained. On success, move the marker from the current Tough Challenge to the first aid symbol between this Tough Challenge and the next one. You now have the usual chance to do one first aid attempt. When it is resolved or you want to skip it, move the marker to the next Tough Challenge.

If you fail a Tough Challenge check, you have to retry the Tough Challenge, but not the side challenges. Their successes still count.

If the finale character manages successes in all three of the Tough Challenges, you win the game. Congratulations!

If all characters are dead or incapacitated, you lose.

*Notes and Clarifications*

The finale character can also take side challenges but suffers a penalty of -1 (or -2 if discovered). This penalty can not be removed.

The finale character can give first aid but also suffers the penalties for the first aid check.

If you have not yet been discovered then two successful side challenges still only remove the -1 penalty. You can not work up a bonus by succeeding at side challenges.
