Day 2
> Are leisure activities done in groups, pairs, alone?

Some of today's trends have intensified, like social isolation and meditation of personal contact by technology. Most people live in cities and don't know their neighbours, let alone other people on their block. Who you meet is often determined by dating apps, forums and the like. But the definition of being alone is blurred by sophisticated VR and AR tech that allows communication almost as if you were in the same room.

@askesemann@notbird.site Interesting~ So people don't see other people much in person, but they do via VR? How do they handle touch?

@aldersprig Ah, that may have come across more extreme than intended. I'd say that people still meet in person more than they do in VR, but less than we do nowadays. I suppose there is some touch simulation, but it's expensive and a bit clumsy. Augmented reality is more common - you might meet someone and a third person might join via an avatar because they can't make it physically.

@askesemann@notbird.site Okay, I see :-D (Most of my friends live online, so there's that "I'd love to be able to hug you but..." problem sometimes)

@aldersprig Interesting point! That would be a great topic to explore in a future story. I guess it hasn't come up in the current one yet because I'm focusing on one city (called "Bedlam"). Note that there's large stretches of wasteland between this city and the other centres of civilization, so it may be too much effort to maintain good communication lines, which would cause the net to fragment somewhat. But friendships have been built on less, so I'll keep it in mind!

@aldersprig Tangent thought: There are people with special abilities which affect others who can see or hear them. Sirens have power over those who hear their song; nymphs use visual contact. I've already decided that there are cyber-implants that give you some protection from these abilities, but what happens if you hear a siren's song in VR, or see a nymph on video chat? ðŸ¤”

@askesemann@notbird.site ooh! Ooh, I like that train of thought. How do they get these abilities?

@aldersprig They're innate. Only women can have them, and they're passed down from mother to daughter. They're not magic; the effect is tied to visual or acoustic patterns triggering a reaction in the brain. So whether it works over video, phone or VR depends on how well these patterns are preserved when encoding and decoding the signal. The level of technology I'm imagining for this world should be enough for it to work - if you can afford it. But then again, you may not want that...

@askesemann@notbird.site yeah, I'm not sure I'd want to spend extra for something to let sirens try to lure me more effectively.

@aldersprig But actually, if it's just patterns of light or sound, then you could simply record them and play them back, or build a machine that generates them, or, in principle, learn to make them, i. e. sing like a siren or move like a nymph. I'm not sure that works for what I have in mind. I'll have to think about it.

Thanks for the inspiring questions, I don't know whether I'd have thought of this by myself! ðŸ˜€

@askesemann@notbird.site Hooray! Those are my favorite worldbuilding questions :-D

Day 3
> Whoâ€™s usually expectedÂ to be someoneâ€™s cheerleader?Â 
> Their partner? Parent? Friends? Mentor?

Social norms and role models create the expectation that everyone is self-sufficient. It's phrased in a positive way - "Believe in yourself" etc. - but it can have destructive consequences. Individuals on the other hand often expect their romantic partners to encourage them, but long-lasting relationships are on the decline, and the number of singles is rising.

@askesemann@notbird.site Ooh that sounds bleak. Especially if you're only relying on your romantic partners for support.

@aldersprig
I know, right? It's a pretty dark and broken world I'm building there. ðŸ˜•

@aldersprig You bet there are. And I'm hoping the darkness will only make them shine all the brighter. âœ¨

Day 4

> Do people form groups with people that are the same age as them?

Yes, much like they do in the real world. In the early years it's mostly based on education - class mates, college buddies. Later, depending on your work, you may or may not associate with age peers. Old age is mostly spent in retirement homes, where you're surrounded with people of a similar age again.

Online it's a different picture of course. Groups are much more diverse on the net.
