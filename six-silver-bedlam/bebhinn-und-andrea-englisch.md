"It's not you. It's this situation I can't handle any more." At least Andrea had the decency to look distraught. He stood near the door with his shoulders slumped, his hands clasped before him. 

Bébhinn was not really surprised. She had sensed something for a while. Even so she felt anger rise. "Oh yeah, and so you dump the freak, and poof! the situation goes away."

He frowned and looked down. "You're not a freak."

Bébhinn bellowed a short laugh. "You mean there are even better reasons for choosing her over me?"

He shuffled his feet. She took some small satisfaction from seeing him writhe under her accusations. "I had to choose, and I didn't make it easy on myself."

"No, of course you didn't. But still you arrived at the obvious conclusion. The future belongs to her, not me." She looked him up and down. "I used to think you were not like the others. I was wrong. You're all the same. The moment you find out what we are, what we can do, you either pull away, shun us, try to forget us, or you lock us up, put us in silver shackles, try to control us. You men are the worst, of course. Your fragile egos cannot handle the fact that you cannot have what we have, be what we are. It may be exciting to play with us for a while, but eventually you get scared, and then it's fight or flight."

"That's not fair," Andrea protested. "I'm not responsible for what other men do. I've always been straight with you. You can't just wave around the fact that you're a banshee whenever it's convenient."

Bébhinn gasped. "Convenient?" The spark of anger was quickly turning into a steady flame. "Don't you dare. I'm not the one looking for the easy way out here."

"Neither am I," Andrea snapped. His posture had changed. He was looking a full inch taller now. Bébhinn was suddenly aware of the subtle pressure of her hand gun against her ribs. "You're not happy with my decision, I get it. I don't like it either. But don't make it political when it's really about you not getting what you want."

Bébhinn ground her teeth. "Fuck you, Andrea," she hissed. "Really. You're not happy? You got everything you wanted out of this. You got to fuck Lexa, you got to fuck me, and now that you're tired of it, tired of me, you get to walk away."
