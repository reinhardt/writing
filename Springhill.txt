A reddish brown filled the small windows of the crammed spaceship cabin where Ruddick and his dozen fellow travellers impatiently awaited the docking to the space station and the subsequent transfer to the surface of the gigantic lump of rock that was the planet of Springhill. The voyage from Arkadia had taken just over eleven hours. Given the distance of almost 25 lightyears, this was nothing short of a miracle; yet it was still too long for the average human passenger to remain comfortable. Quantum Warp Spin Inversion, the technology that made travelling times like this possible, hab been around long enough to establish flourishing transport routes between the nearer stars and their planets, yet scientists were still struggling to explain why exactly it worked and what prevented the time paradoxa that Einstein and his successors had predicted. It was similar with Ruddick's own area of expertise, Tachyon Fields. The existence of these subatomic fields had not been known until a few years ago, and their properties were largely unknown, still here he was, approaching the mines of Springhill to conduct experiments with new Tachyon Field based drilling tools.
