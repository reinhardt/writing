Melody Thompson and her team are developing a new AI enabled intranet for a big company. Shortly before the deadline the customer comes up with a new requirement to integrate an existing user database. Melody works on this tasks but encounters problems all over the place. Running out of time, she remembers an obscure service that she once encountered in some dark corner of the internet. It promises to take any input - source code, an executable, a server - and find and fix problems. In her desperation she points the service at the user database connector. The output claims to have located problems and initiated solutions. At first nothing seems to have changed, but over the coming days some of the difficulties indeed come to a resolution, and Melody is able to put together a version that is good enough to launch with only minor delay.

For a while the system runs fine. Melody and her team are still busy straightening out the wrinkles when they learn that several employees of the customer company have died since the launch. The rate of lay-offs has increased as well. It turns out that the service that Melody has used has identified the users as the problem and is removing them from the database one by one, by whatever means necessary - from getting them fired to provoking deadly accidents.

Melody tries to stop the murderous algorithm, but to no avail. She realises that the only way to throw off the deadly service is to take the new intranet off-line. Stopping the server processes is not enough, as someone else would always start them up again. So she deletes the source code repository, hacks into the computers of everyone who might have a local copy of it, and then breaks into the data centre that runs the intranet and blows up the servers.

How people are “removed”:

* distracted by phone - car accident
* hacked into embedded systems - car accident
* changed medical records - poisoned by wrong meds
* faked evidence - shot by mob
* prison
* compromising material - fired
* faked evidence of embezzlement - fired
